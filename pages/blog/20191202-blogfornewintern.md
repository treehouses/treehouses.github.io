Welcome to Treehouses

Congratulations! You have completed the first steps and have been selected to join the treehouses virtual intern team. 

## How to review Pull Requests
One of your responsibilities as an intern is to review and help prospective interns with their issues and pull requests on treehouses.github.io. 
So, it would be very important to understand how to review pull requests.

1. **Check branches:** the prospective interns should create a new branch every time when they start working on new issues (one issue per one pull request)

    `Warning: they should not work on their master branch!`

1. **Review files:** you can comment, approve, and request changes in the 'Files Changed'. For this step, you should take your time to review a file. Do not rush :)
1. **Check the raw.githack link:** the raw.githack link is very important for us for reviewing interns' works. It should be in this pattern `https://raw.githack.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io/YourBranchName/#!pages/vi/profiles/YourUserName.md`. 

## How to merge Pull Requests
The pull request can be merged if at least two other people have approved the pull request and there are no more changes requested by another intern.

1. **Select squash and merge**
1. **Delete all the commit messages:** It is very crucial to delete all the commit messages. `You must not forget this step!`
1. **Check title:** In the title of pull requests must included a keyword to automatically close the issue, for example, `(fix #issue number)` or `(fixes #issue number)`. [READ MORE ABOUT CLOSING ISSUES USING KEYWORDS](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) 
    * if you accidently merged PRs which not included closing keywords, you need to manually close the issue and link it to the original pull request.

## Working Routine
We recommend you follow this basic daily routine:

1. [Check gitter chat](https://gitter.im/treehouses/Lobby)
1. Review any issues or pull requests that have been added or changed on [treehouses.github.io](https://github.com/treehouses/treehouses.github.io) since last time you reviewed.
