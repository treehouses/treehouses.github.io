Welcome to Treehouses

Congratulations! You have completed the first steps and have been selected to join the treehouses virtual intern team. 

## How to review Pull Requests
One of your responsibilities as an intern is to review and help prospective interns with their issues and pull requests on treehouses.github.io. 
So, it would be very important to understand how to review pull requests.

1. **Check branches:** the prospective interns should create a new branch every time when they start working on new issues (one issue per one pull request)

    `Warning: they should not work on their master branch!`

1. **Review files:** you can comment, approve, and request changes in the 'Files Changed'. For this step, you should take your time to review a file. Do not rush :)
1. **Check the raw.githack link:** the raw.githack link is very important for us for reviewing interns' works. It should be in this pattern `https://raw.githack.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io/YourBranchName/#!pages/vi/profiles/YourUserName.md`.
