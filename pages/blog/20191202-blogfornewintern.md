This blog is about working with aspiring interns.

Your job are 
* Welcome all new aspiring intern and send them the link `https://treehouses.io/#!pages/vi/firststeps.md`
* Reviewing issues and pull requests in [treehouses.github.io](https://github.com/treehouses/treehouses.github.io)
* Merging PRs
* Answer all the questions when they have problems (they might send you a private message so please regularly check your Gitter  )

    
## How to review Pull Requests and Issues
One of your responsibilities as an intern is to review and help prospective interns with their issues and pull requests on treehouses.github.io. 
So, it would be very important to understand how to review pull requests.

1. **Check branches:** the prospective interns should create a new branch every time when they start working on new issues (one issue per one pull request)

    `Warning: they should not work on their master branch!`

1. **Review files:** you can comment, approve, and request changes in the 'Files Changed'. For this step, you should take your time to review a file. Do not rush :)
1. **Check the raw.githack link:** the raw.githack link is very important for us for reviewing interns' works. It should be in this pattern `https://raw.githack.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io/YourBranchName/#!pages/vi/profiles/YourUserName.md`. 

Every time you comment on an issue or review a pull request, message those involved on the Gitter chat with a link to the issue / pull request. 
For example: 
```
@usernameofintern please see my comments (URL link of the issue or pull request)
```
Also, if you find any issue that must be addressed with a pull request, do not forget to use the Request changes option when starting your review.

## How to merge Pull Requests
The pull request can be merged if at least two other people have approved the pull request and there are no more changes requested by another intern.

1. **Select squash and merge**
1. **Delete all the commit messages:** It is very crucial to delete all the commit messages. `You must not forget this step!`
1. **Check title:** In the title of pull requests must included a keyword to automatically close the issue, for example, `(fix #issue number)` or `(fixes #issue number)`. [READ MORE ABOUT CLOSING ISSUES USING KEYWORDS](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) 
    * if you accidently merged PRs which not included closing keywords, you need to manually close the issue and link it to the original pull request.
    
Every time you merge the pull requests, please send a message to the interns on the Gitter chat with a link to the issue and merged link. For example:

```
@usernameofintern please look at (URL link of the issue) and (URL link of the merged link)
```

## Working Routine
We recommend you follow this basic daily routine:

1. [Check gitter chat](https://gitter.im/treehouses/Lobby)
1. Review any issues or pull requests that have been added or changed on [treehouses.github.io](https://github.com/treehouses/treehouses.github.io) since last time you reviewed.
1. Make pull requests as early as possible so you can get feedback as you work.
1. Join the Google hangout session at [http://talk.ole.org]( http://talk.ole.org). At the Hangout meeting, we will discuss about our projects. If you have any questions, you can also ask the team at the meeting.

**NOTE**:
* if you are not be able to join the hangout, please left a message to Dogi. 
* Before leaving the hangout, you need to do check out with Dogi.
* Share you screen every time 
* For Treehouses, we have three sessions which are
