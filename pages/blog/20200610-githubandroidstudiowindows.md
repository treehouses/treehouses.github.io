### Set up your device as follows:
1. Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you developed on Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device
1. Perform the following steps to enable **USB debugging** in the **Developer options** window:
    1. Open the **Settings** app
    1. If your device uses Android v8.0 or higher, select **System**. Otherwise, proceed to the next step
    1. Scroll to the bottom and select **About phone**
    1. Scroll to the bottom and tap **Build number** seven times
    1. Return to the previous screen, scroll to the bottom, and tap **Developer options**
    1. In the **Developer options** window, scroll down to find and enable **USB debugging**
 
### Run the app on your device as follows:
1\. In Android Studio, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu in the toolbar

2\. In the toolbar, select the device that you want to run your app on from the target device drop-down menu

3\. Click **Run** \(the green play button\) or press `Shift + F10` \(Windows/Linux\) or `Control + R` \(Mac\)
 
### Run on an emulator

Run the app on an emulator as follows:

    1. To create an Android Virtual Device, open the AVD Manager by clicking **Tools > AVD Manager**
    1. Click **Create Virtual Device** at the bottom of the AVD Manager dialog
    1. Select a hardware profile and then click **Next**
    1. Select the system image for a particular API level, and then click **Next**
    1. Change any **AVD properties** as needed and then click **Finish**. You find more about creating an AVD [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd) 
1. In the toolbar, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu
1. From the target device drop-down menu, select the AVD that you want to run your app on
