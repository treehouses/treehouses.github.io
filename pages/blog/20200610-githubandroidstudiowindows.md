## Running the project

You should be able to run the project on a real device or an emulator. For your convenience, the following steps on how to run are taken from [here](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app)

### Set up your device as follows:
1. Connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you developed on Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device
1. Perform the following steps to enable **USB debugging** in the **Developer options** window:
    1. Open the **Settings** app
    1. If your device uses Android v8.0 or higher, select **System**. Otherwise, proceed to the next step
    1. Scroll to the bottom and select **About phone**
    1. Scroll to the bottom and tap **Build number** seven times
    1. Return to the previous screen, scroll to the bottom, and tap **Developer options**
    1. In the **Developer options** window, scroll down to find and enable **USB debugging**
 
### Run the app on your device as follows:
1\. In Android Studio, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu in the toolbar

2\. In the toolbar, select the device that you want to run your app on from the target device drop-down menu

3\. Click **Run** \(the green play button\) or press `Shift + F10` \(Windows/Linux\) or `Control + R` \(Mac\)
 
### Run on an emulator

Run the app on an emulator as follows:

1. In Android Studio, create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that the emulator can use to install and run your app
    1. To create an Android Virtual Device, open the AVD Manager by clicking **Tools > AVD Manager**
    1. Click **Create Virtual Device** at the bottom of the AVD Manager dialog
    1. Select a hardware profile and then click **Next**
    1. Select the system image for a particular API level, and then click **Next**
    1. Change any **AVD properties** as needed and then click **Finish**. You find more about creating an AVD [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd) 
1. In the toolbar, select your app from the run/debug configurations drop-down menu
1. From the target device drop-down menu, select the AVD that you want to run your app on
