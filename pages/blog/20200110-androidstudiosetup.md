This blog is about how to setup [Android Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio) for the [treehouses remote](https://github.com/treehouses/remote) repository.
These projects rely on the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) programming language and Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android Apps.

## Download Android Studio

1. Android Studio is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms. Go ahead and download the installer. 
[Download Link](https://developer.android.com/studio).

2. Install Android Studio by running the installer. Make sure you select
Android Virtual Device in the components section of the install becuase you 
will need this to run an emulator to test your APKs you build.
