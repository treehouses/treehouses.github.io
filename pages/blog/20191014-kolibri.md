Kolibri is a platform used by our "competitor" organization called Learning Equality similar to what Planet is for Open Learning Exchange.

Below are instructions on how to run Kolibri on treehouses:

1. Plug your RPi in and ssh into treehouses
1. If you don't already have docker installed, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/) on their official page to install it on mac/windows
1. Now, go to the [treehouses github](https://github.com/treehouses)
1. Scroll down until you find the `kolibri` repository
1. Once in the repo, scroll down to where the readme.md file is displayed
1. Copy the link provided: `docker run -v /data/save/location:/root/.kolibri -p 8080:8080 treehouses/kolibri`
1. Replace `/data/save/location` with `/srv/kolibri`
1. Run the above command in your terminal
1. Give it some time to process
1. Enter your RPi IP address in browser followed by :8080, Example: `192.168.1.8:8080`
1. You should now see the Kolibri interface

1. You can import learning materials the same way you would in the planet
