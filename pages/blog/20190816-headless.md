# Raspberry Pi Headless Setup

Don’t have an extra keyboard or monitor?? Here’s how to do a headless Raspberry Pi setup with a [treehouses](http://download.treehouses.io/) image, which is our modified version of Debian.

## Hardware requirements:
1.  Raspberry Pi 4 B, 3 B/B+, or Zero W
1.  Power cord
	- 3A USB-C for Pi 4, 2.5A microUSB for Pi 3 B/B+, or 1.2A microUSB for Pi Zero W
1.  3 Class 10 or U1 microSD cards
	- minimum 16GB, but we recommend 32GB or greater
1.  A microSD card reader
	- Check your computer if you have a slot for a card reader, otherwise use a USB reader
1.  Ethernet cable or wifi dongle
1.  Laptop or computer with mimimum of 8 GB of free hard-drive space and 8 GB of RAM



## Step 0 - Prepare image

Download the [latest treehouses image](http://download.treehouses.io/) to your computer, and flash it onto your microSD card using [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.io).

## Step 1 - SSH file

Open your file explorer and find the microSD card; it should be named "boot".

Enable [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) by creating a file named `ssh` (without any extension) onto the boot drive.

On macOS: 
1. Open Textedit and create a new file
2. Select "Make plain text" in the Format menu
3. Save the file with the name `ssh` inside the boot drive, and deselect “If no ext. is provided, use .txt”

On Windows:
1. Create a new file with Notepad
2. Save the file with the name `ssh` as a plain text file inside the boot drive, without a file extension.

## Step 2: Get your RPi Up and Running

Unmount your SD card and place it inside the RPi.  
Connect the Pi to your laptop via ethernet cable and plug in its power cord. 

Give it a few minutes to get started and check for the flashing green light to make sure the image burned correctly. 

## Step 3: Accessing Treehouses 

Open up your terminal or command prompt. To configure your Pi, you will need the IP address. To do this, enter the command:
~~~
ping treehouses.local
~~~

Once the IP address appears press Ctrl + C.

Copy the IP address and paste it into the command below.

SSH into the Pi by using:
~~~
ssh pi@enter_IP_address_here
~~~
You will now see a message that reads
```bash
Authenticity of host can't be established, are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no)
```
You will enter yes and then be prompted for a password which in all cases for RPis is "raspberry" until you change it.

## Step 4: Set Up RealVNC

Enable VNC on your Pi by running the following in your terminal while SSHed in:
~~~
sudo -s
treehouses vnc on
reboot
~~~

Download [RealVNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/)

Once it finishes downloading, open it up and enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi that you found earlier in the search bar.  You may be prompted to log in: username `pi`, password `raspberry`.  Your Pi desktop should appear.

## Step 5:  View your treehouses desktop

Once you're back inside treehouses, open up RealVNC again and enter the Pi's IP address once more, the desktop should now appear. You will be prompted for a password (raspberry) and a few more prompts, but otherwise everything should now be up and running.
