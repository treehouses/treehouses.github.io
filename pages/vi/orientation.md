# Virtual Intern Orientation

## Welcome to the treehouses Intern Team!

Congratulations! You have completed the first steps and have been selected to join treehouses the Open Learning Exchange's Systems Engineering team.
Please remember that we expect interns to contribute at least 16 hours a week for a minimum duration of 3 months, in which time you will be working on the treehouses repositories to solve issues and develop tools for the Open Learning Exchange.

If you do not think that this is a commitment that you can currently honor, we are happy to accept you later on when you are able to!

## Get to Know the Team

The first thing is to meet the team, starting with CTO [dogi](https://github.com/dogi), then the [current intern team  members](team.md). After having the initial meeting with dogi, you can join <http://talk.ole.org> during Google Hangouts session to meet with current interns, get to know each other, and ask them what they have been working on.

## Familiarize Yourself with Current Projects and Issues

Interns usually choose what project they want to work on based on their experience. If you get tired of a certain project, there is an opportunity to switch. Take a look at our current projects below, if any particular ones interest you, there is a very good chance that you can work on them.

To stay up to date with the projects you are contributing to, make sure you "star" the repository in GitHub.

### Active System Teams Projects

#### [treehouses.io](https://github.com/treehouses/treehouses.github.io/)

## A Few Things to Know...

Once you officially become a virtual intern, you will receive email invites to become GitHub organization members of [treehouses](https://github.com/treehouses), [open-learning-exchange](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange), and [ole-vi](https://github.com/ole-vi).

**Now you should work on treehouses's repositories instead of your own forked repositories, the workflow will be [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)**. Note that this will give you the ability to make bigger mistakes - so make sure you always double check what branch you are working on. Remember to commit often and create pull requests early, so other virtual interns can look at your code and make sure you are on the right track at an early stage.

You will now have the ability to review, close, and merge pull requests and issues.

Once you have accepted your invitation, mark yourself as a public member in the [list of OLE contributors.](https://github.com/orgs/treehouses/people)

### Reviewing Pull Requests and Issues

One major responsibility as an intern is to review and help prospective interns with their issues / pull request in OLE treehouses. You can start a review by going to the files changed tab on a pull request. You can read more about [Review on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/).

Since we are a very diverse community with people coming from different background and culture, it might be hard to find the right language to use in reviewing other's code. Please make sure to read [**a guide for reviewing code and having your code reviewed**](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review#code-review) for some useful tips.

You should check if the following conditions are met:

* [x] issue number is included in pull request title and description
* [x] there are no unnecessary files/lines change in pull request
* [x] there's a branch for the patch
* [x] the pull request actually fixes the issue
* [x] changes are rendered correctly on rawgit preview
* [x] no merge conflicts
* [x] commits are associated with GitHub account

When you comment / review an issue or pull request, message those involved on the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/treehouses/Lobby) with a link to the issue / pull request. Also, if you find any issue that must be addressed with another commit, do not forget to use the `Request changes` option when creating your review.

### Merging a Pull Request

The pull request can be merged if at least two other people have approved the pull request and there are no more changes requested by another intern. One exception is when virtual interns are adding themselves to the team, we want the new intern to merge their pull request during their interview.

When you are ready to merge the pull request:

* Select "Squash Merge"
* **Remove all of the commit messages in the extended description, and make sure the commit title is clear and short.**
* Include “(fixes #IssueNumber)” in the title so it will automatically close the issue.
  * If you forget to add a keyword, go to the issue and manually close it and link to the original pull request.
  * An example of good commit title is: "update vi-configuration.md (fix #1530) (#1557)", where "1530" is the issue number and "1557" is pull request number.
  * Read more about [closing Issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).

Every time you merge a pull request, message the author on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/treehouses/Lobby), make sure you include a link to the pull request and commit id.

## Form a Working Routine and Schedule

### Recommended Daily Routine

While you are free to work in your own style, we recommend you follow this basic daily routine:

* Check Gitter interns room and your Gitter private messages.
* Join the [OLE Google Hangouts session](http://talk.ole.org) if you are able to, so you can follow what everyone is working on and get help fast.
* Review any issues or pull requests that have been added or changed on [treehouses.io](https://github.com/treehouses/treehouses.github.io) since last time you reviewed.
* Work on your issues and write in the intern chat any time you run into problems.
* Make pull requests as early as possible so you can get feedback as you work.
* Try to close issues using some of the following keywords and variations of them in the headings: `close`, `fix` and `resolve`. [Closing Issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)

### Weekly Schedule

All of our Google Hangouts sessions can be joined at <http://talk.ole.org>. Currently, we have a few scheduled sessions each week:

* Happy Hacking Hangout
* angular asia (h)acking (h)angout
* Systems Hacking Hangout
* Mobile Hacking Backup Hangout
* Raspberry Pi Hangout
* Angular Hacking Hangout
* Secret Hacking Hangout


Every Monday at the "[Happy hacking hangout](http://talk.ole.org)" session, we work on problems together and catch up on what people have been doing all week. It is also advisable to schedule a day out of the week to meet with a team leader, especially if you can’t make it to the meeting. Use the calendar to set up meetings and other events with interns.

Please subscribe to our calendar:

* In [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), paste `ole.org_u2koassrool56icb7fqko9abac@group.calendar.google.com` into "*Add a friend's calendar*" and **hit `Enter` (do not click the + sign)**.
* Use [this iCalendar file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/ole.org_u2koassrool56icb7fqko9abac%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to access our calendar from other applications.

## Communicate, Communicate, Communicate!

It’s not good to go silent on Gitter or any other forms of communication. If you are ever unsure of what to work on, or cannot work for any other reason, please talk to us in the Gitter chat. It's better that we know why you aren’t able to do anything than to imagine reasons ourselves. Remember, the more you put into this internship, the more you will get out of it. It may take a while to get used to the fact that you will need a good amount of self-discipline and initiative to get anything done in a remote internship, but we are here to help, so take advantage of it!
