## About
I was a student in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Engineering in Drexel University 🐲.

Besides from classwork, I workout, read books, watch TV (sitcoms, soccers).

In the past I have had some Raspberry Pi activities at school and done other fun projects with friends in some Hackathons. 

I look forward to be part of the group and doing meaningful projects with everyone in upcoming time.
