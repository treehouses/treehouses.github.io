### Hello everyone! My name is Rohan and I am a rising senior computer science student in Colorado. ###
I have previous experience with software development, full stack web development, and software engineering.
I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and spend a lot of free time reading up 
on different AI/ML concepts. I am very well versed in software and am here to expand 
my skill-set even more to include working with Raspberry PI.
