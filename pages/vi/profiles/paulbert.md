I'm a former advertising/web analyst in Somerville, MA who decided to make a career change to get into web development.  I studied music in college and focused on composition.  **This means I have two lists:**

### Instruments I am comfortable playing in front of people
* Voice
* Guitar
* Electric Bass Guitar
* Ukulele

**and**

### Instruments I have played music that is not nonsense
* Piano
* Flute
* Drums
* Double/Upright Bass

I also enjoy traveling, cooking, soccer, and ultimate frisbee.
