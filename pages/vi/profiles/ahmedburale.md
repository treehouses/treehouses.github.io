> Over the past experiences, I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. Having been a student, a father of two 
> kids, and a husband, what ideas should I be doing now to prepare for my internship pre-requisites? I am so excited to learn from you and develop more competent skills and 
> experiment in the virtual systems engineering interns' teamwork learning environment.
