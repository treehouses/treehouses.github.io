```bash
Rpi, Orange Pi, Odroid, ...
```
and other little wonders.
I have fun with various languages 

```bash
C, C++, Rust, Lua, Python,...
```

```bash
javascript, nodejs, Angular, Vuejs, Electron, Hoodie,...
```
 for front and 

```bash

```
 for the back-end, on different real time or non-real time OS.
