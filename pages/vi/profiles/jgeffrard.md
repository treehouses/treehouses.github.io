# About Me

1. My name is Jonathan Geffrard.
2. I live in New Jersey in the United States on the East Coast.
3. I am a third-year Computer Science student. 
4. I use Windows 10 but I've used Linux as well (Ubuntu) in the past.

### Hobbies
* Hackathons.
* Sleeping.
* Reading.

**I use Java these days but I also use Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS regularly as well.**
I have also dabbled in some other languages trying to crack some math riddles (you can see that on my GitHub).
Here is a link to my [Github](https://github.com/jgeffrard "Github").

_I'm happy to be here and am looking forward to learning a bunch of new things!_
