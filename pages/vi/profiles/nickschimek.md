## Nick Schimek

Hello everyone ![wave](https://res.cloudinary.com/da0cmt1gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_29/v1582421576/hiwave_q9twst.gif), my name is [Nick](https://www.nickschimek.com/) and I'm currently residing 
in [Tokyo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tokyo/@35.5079446,139.2093944,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x605d1b87f02e57e7:0x2e01618b22571b89!8m2!3d35.6761919!4d139.6503106) (JST). Day to day I use OSX, but I also have Win 10 and Linux PC's. 

I am familiar with a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, API's, etc...:

 - Ruby
 - Java
 - C/C++
 - Python
 - and more...
 
I currently enjoy hacking away using the Sublime text editor, but that may change in the future. I have used other text editors, and you may find me using a specific editor for certain projects/languages.

This is one of my favorite quotes.

> When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.

-Helen Keller
