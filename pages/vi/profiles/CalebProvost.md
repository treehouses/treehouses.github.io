Hello everyone,


I was born in California and moved to Oregon when I was 9. I eventually moved to South Korea to study while teaching. It was a wonderful opportunity that allowed me to teach underprivileged-rural-students English while I worked towards earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Technology and gave me time to travel the world.

I have visited:
- Republic of Korea
- Japan
- Thailand
- France
- Netherlands
- Germany
- Poland
- Czech Republic
- Austria
- Italy

Will soon visit and plan to visit:
- Iceland (Winter 2019)
- Canada
- Mexico
- South Africa
- New Zealand & Austraila
- Somewhere in South America
- and Antarctica

As you can see, travelling is a passion of mine, but not the only one. More often than not I can be found using what I've learned through my BS Degree to build electronics, code programs, and make websites. I just finished a course with Code-Louisville in Front End Web Development and I’m currently completing the Full-stack Development certificate this winter semester with Python. 

I’m dedicated to learning all things technology that interact with the world, and welcome any opportunity that allows me to strengthen my skills and use my acquired knowledge; so feel free to share or ask questions!
