I am an incoming sophomore studying Computer Science and Data Science at Arizona State University (ASU). My interests lie in utilizing Machine Learning to optimize normal processes. 
My last research paper detailed how ML could aid developing countries in their pursuit of constructing infrastructure. In order to create such a model, I am currently 
learning common industry ML frameworks. 

To further my involvement in Data Science,  
I have also taken on a position as the Vice President of a Data Science organization at ASU.

I am interested in: 

  * Basketball
  * Football
  * Track & Field
  
  My Favorite Sports Team is the [Lakers](https://www.nba.com/lakers/)
