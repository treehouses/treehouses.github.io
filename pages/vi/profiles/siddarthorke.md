I got my Master's in Telecommunication and Network Engineering in 2015 from Southern Methodist University, Dallas TX. 
I recently got certified as a "Cisco Certified Network Professional".
I'm currently looking to diversify my resume and get into Web Development. 

One of the prime motivators to get into Web Development is a quote from **Richard Dawkins**:

> "Personally, I rather look forward to a computer program winning the world chess championship. Humanity needs a lesson in humility."

A novice at `Python` (self-taught) and an AI enthusiast.

```python

```

Outside of work, I play DOTA (2) and have been playing DOTA for 10 years now. I also started learning drums (self-taught). I love to travel!
