Hello everyone! My name is Saurabh. I'm a a graduate student at California State University - Fullerton, majoring in computer science.   

I'm a big fan of soccer, badminton, *and* table tennis.  
I'm currently learning `Emacs`, and try to use it as much as possible. 

Here are some of the technologies that I'm working on:

  * Python Flask
  * PostgreSQL
  * NGINX
  * Docker

> “It's not panic. It's not terror that I feel, that I think most people feel, it's a kind of gnawing anxiety where you say to yourself, I shouldn't go out. If I do go out, I might catch this thing or I might give it to somebody else.”  

― Stephen King
