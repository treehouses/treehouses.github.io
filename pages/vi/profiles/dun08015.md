**Short Description:** 

I am an information systems technician in the US Navy. I am 32 years old and plan to leave the Navy in October 2020.

I am married and have a seven year old daughter. In my free time I enjoy playing video games with friends and sailing. 

Here is a link to a [website](http://dunbarjohn.com) I made with a bit of my resume on it. The page and my resume are not that good. Please dont judge.

I have been messing around with Unity to try and make a 2D game. Here is my main character running:

Here is some code from that project. It checks if the current arm animation should be rotated to match the mouse movement.

```cs
    private void armsRotationCheck()
    {
        armsClipInfo = myAnimator.GetCurrentAnimatorClipInfo(0);

        armsClipName = armsClipInfo[0].clip.name;

        if (armsClipName == "ArmsShoot" || armsClipName == "ArmsShootPrep" || armsClipName == "ArmsPunch" 
            || armsClipName ==  "ArmsPunchPrep")
        {
            arms.rotate();
        }
    }
```
