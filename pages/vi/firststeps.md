# First Steps – Systems Engineering Virtual Intern

## The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming a Systems Engineering Virtual Intern at OLE! We treat these first steps as a vetting process to prove that you can follow simple instructions before you can progress to working on harder projects in bigger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE systems engineering interns team! We’ll add you to relevant Discord channels and assign you to a specific team to work on developing and improving OLE’s **[treehouses](https://github.com/treehouses)** software, which directly supports the deployment of OLE's [planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet) and [myPlanet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet) app.

During this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with various software, tools, and technologies, including **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**, **[Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)**, **[Bash/Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)**, **[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)**, and **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**. Furthermore, you will be able to learn and practice your skills in using **[Raspberry Pi Hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/)**.

OLE's goal is to provide educational infrastructure to learners and educators in remote areas around the world. To support this mission, we use Raspberry Pi devices as a cost-effective solution for delivering access to educational resources. Our objective is to create a stable system that is widely compatible with various devices and operating systems. Since this equipment is often deployed in areas with limited or no internet access, ensuring its reliability is absolutely critical.

**NOTE**: This is an unpaid, intensive internship requiring a minimum commitment of 24 hours per week for at least 3 months. Additional details about the internship can be found in our [FAQ](faq.md#General_Internship_Questions). If you have further questions, feel free to ask in our Discord server's #seednest channel!

## The Steps

Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Docker, Bash, Vim, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc.

**These steps may seem simple, but we expect high-quality work, which may require additional time. We want to see that you can effectively use — or learn to use — these tools, including writing clear GitHub issues, using basic Git commands, creating proper pull requests, and working with Docker. Simply following the steps is the bare minimum; we encourage you to read more about the tools and languages we use to deepen your understanding and address any confusion. Treat these steps as valuable learning opportunities!**

Take the opportunity to read more about the tools and languages we use to deepen your understanding and reduce confusion. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice in first steps are crucial for both this internship and a future career in software development.

The MDwiki offers plenty of resources to help you complete these steps. You may find a list of useful links at the end of each step. :)

**We also would like you to keep us regularly updated in our Discord server's `#seednest` channel as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send messages, links, and screenshots along the way, which will keep us informed of your progress. Please make sure not to miss this.**

A significant part of these steps is identifying problems or suggesting improvements for this MDwiki. As you complete the steps, take note of any issues you encounter or ideas for enhancements. This helps improve the MDwiki and these steps for future interns.

While there's no official deadline for completing these steps, most successful candidates finish them within 7-8 days. Good luck!

## Step 0 - Introductory Steps

Follow the instructions in [Introductory Steps](introductory-steps.md) to watch the organization, join Discord, set up your environment, and learn Vi/Vim basics.

## Step 1 - Installing and Finding Your Raspberry Pi

**NOTE:** You can skip ahead to Step 3 if you are waiting for your Raspberry Pi to come in the mail.

This step is divided into three sections:

1. [Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi](pi-setup.md)
2. [Using the Treehouses Remote App](treehouses-remote.md)
3. [Finding the Raspberry Pi on Your Local Network](find-pi.md)

## Step 2 - Use SSH and Tor to Remotely Control Your Raspberry Pi

The Systems team uses SSH (Secure Shell) to securely and remotely control the Raspberry Pis we work with.  SSH works by providing an admin protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.  Follow the [Raspberry Pi SSH  & Tor Tutorial](sshpi.md) to learn how.

## Step 3 - Markdown and Fork Tutorial

Follow the instructions on [GitHub and Markdown](githubandmarkdown.md)

Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and pull request in the [Discord #seednest channel](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1081433296333963274). Also, include the `raw.githack` link in your pull request `https://raw.githack.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io/YourBranchName/#!pages/vi/profiles/YourUserName.md`

**NOTE**: The `raw.githack` link is case sensitive to your username.


> Once you complete Step 3 you will have:

* 1 Pull request made

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)


## Step 4 - System Tutorial

### Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. In this step, you will learn about how to interact with Vagrant through the command-line interface.
Follow the directions in the [Vagrant Tutorial](vagranttutorial.md)

### Docker

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization. In this step, you will learn the basics of interacting with Docker and Docker Compose through the command-line interface and basic commands for maintaining your Planet installation.
Follow the directions in the [Docker Tutorial](dockertutorial.md)


## Step 5 - Keeping Fork Updated

Follow the directions at [Git Repositories](gitrepositories.md) to keep your username.github.io and your local repository up to date.


## Step 6 - GitHub Issues Tutorial

Follow the [GitHub Issues tutorial](github-issues.md) to create at least one issue. Post a link in [Discord #seednest channel](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1081433296333963274) whenever you create an issue or when you comment on someone else's issue. You are encouraged to post as many issues as you can for improving the page as well as for personal practice. No issue is too big or too small to be filed and it is OK if you are not sure how to fix it yourself. If you know how to solve an issue, be sure to provide a detailed account of your research and show how to fix it. It is ok to file an issue about minor typos and very small changes, but do not make this the case for all of the issues that you file. You can also work on issues that you didn't create.

Make sure you have created at least one issue, resolved it, commented on an issue you didn't create and have a pull request with the fix merged. You may continue making Issues, Pull requests and Comments, or move on to the next step, while you are waiting for your pull request to be merged. The approval process for your Step 6 fix may take time, but it is OK to continue working.

**NOTE**: When posting a link in the Discord channel, it may be helpful to tag the newest interns since they are likely the most active.

> Once you complete Step 6 you will have:

* 2 pull requests made (one at step 3 and one at step 6)
* 1 comment added (on an issue you didn't create)
* 1 issue created

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)

Please note that creating and working on Issues are not exactly bound by the "Step" you are in. Feel free to move on to other steps, and make more Issues and Pull Requests while you wait on OLE approval for your merge(s).


## Step 7 - Other Services Running from a Raspberry Pi

### Nextcloud over Tor

Follow the [Nextcloud and Tor Tutorial](nextcloud-tor.md) to set up the Nextcloud service on your Pi, and access it via Tor.  


## Step 8 - Create Issues and Pull Requests

In this step, we will adopt the motto of "Practice makes Perfect". You will follow the same steps as in **Step 6**, continuing to improve this Markdown Wiki so that it is educational, yet easy to understand for future interns.

You should:

* Add comments to three issues other than your own (somebody else's issue)
* Create three new issues (in addition to those you have already created in previous steps)
  * Get approval to work on the issues you have created. **Make sure someone from the System's team confirms that you should work on the issue BEFORE you start to work on it.**
* Resolve the three issues by making the necessary changes in your repo with three separate pull requests.

Just as your learning with this Wiki was made possible by the efforts of previous interns, now we turn to you to continue that tradition and help future interns take their First Steps. Through this step, you should try to further improve our Markdown Wiki, with better explanations, formatting fixes, and more! You must have made your pull requests and have them each approved by at least two other OLE team members/interns in order for it to be merged to the upstream repository. Just as before, announce your Pull Request on the Discord channel so other members can review it. You may need to make some additional corrections. Learn by teaching - or editing our teaching tool, in this case!

**NOTE**: When you are fixing an issue, mention the issue number you are fixing in the title of your pull request and make a new branch for every new issue from the master branch.

> Once you complete Step 8, you should have:

* 5 merged pull requests (one at step 3, one at step 6 and three at step 8)
* 4 comments made on *issues you didn't create* (one at step 6 and three at step 8)
* 4 issues created (one at step 6 and three at step 8)

**NOTE**: You can track your progress with the number of pull requests and issues [here](trackprogress.md).

## Step 9 - Be Part of the Team

Next thing is to post a screenshot of your completed progress to the [Discord #seednest channel](https://discord.com/channels/1079980988421132369/1081433296333963274). Click [here](trackprogress.md) to find your completed progress.
Message us ("@vi-systems" and "@dogi") and ask about adding yourself to the virtual intern list found in [team.md](team.md) and setting up a meeting so you can become a part of the team as soon as possible.

Make sure to read through the [intern orientation document](orientation.md) before the meeting.
