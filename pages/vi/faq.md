### General Internship Questions

#### Q1: What will I be working on during this internship?

- Systems Engineering Virtual Interns will contribute to developing OLE’s treehouses system. Visit the [treehouses](https://github.com/treehouses) organization on GitHub to explore our ongoing projects. Treehouses projects supports the development and deployment of OLE's [planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet) and [myPlanet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/myplanet) apps.

#### Q2: What kind of software will we be using for this internship?

- During this internship, you will have the opportunity to work with various software, tools, and technologies, including [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands), [Bash/Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Furthermore, you will be able to learn and practice your skills in using [Raspberry Pi Hardware](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/).

#### Q3: Where can I find more information about this internship?

- More information about the internship can be found at the OLE's Virtual Software Engineer Intern listing on your university's Handshake site or [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/company/open-learning-exchange/jobs).

#### Q4: What are the hours of the internship?

- This is an intensive internship requiring 24 hours of work per week for at least 3 months.
- The 3-month commitment is necessary because the onboarding process typically takes 2–4 weeks, leaving about 2 months for productive work. During the final month, you should think about passing along your knowledge to newer interns.
- The 24-hour minimum commitment per week is necessary due to the fast-paced nature of our work, which can make it challenging for virtual interns to stay up to date. We host a Google Meet virtual office from Monday to Friday, approximately 5 AM to 5 PM US Eastern Time. During this time, you can hear about ongoing projects, share your screen, ask questions, discuss challenges, and collaborate on issues. While some tasks can be done offline and outside of the virtual office—especially during unstaffed hours—we generally expect you to be present there for most of your work time. If you find the virtual office too distracting, please discuss this with us.

#### Q5: Is this a paid internship?

- This is an unpaid position but offers a diverse range of workplace experiences. Upon request, we can provide a certificate of completion. Academic credit may be available through your institution (if applicable), and we can assist with paperwork for CPT or first-year OPT.

#### Q6: What happens after the initial steps?

- The initial steps are designed to introduce potential interns to the treehouses system and begin assigning you assignments! To clarify: the first 10 steps serve as a vetting process to assess whether candidates are a good fit for the internship, so consider it part of the interview. Once you complete the 10 steps, are approved, and have had a meeting with us, you will have officially joined the OLE interns team!

#### Q7: If I'm an international student, how soon can I get my paperwork required by my visa?

- Since the First Steps serve as a vetting process, your internship technically doesn't begin until you complete them and have the initial meeting with us. Think of the first 10 steps as part of the application process; you're not working on or contributing to our organizational software, but rather demonstrating that you have the technical background needed to work with us. After completing the first 10 steps and during our initial meeting, let us know if you need us to sign any paperwork, provide organizational information, or issue an offer letter for visa compliance, and we'd be happy to assist.

#### Q8: How many pull requests and issues in total do I need to make to finish the steps?

- To complete the initial steps, you need to create a **minimum** of 4 issues and have 5 **merged** pull requests. This will help you become familiar with Git/GitHub/Markdown, demonstrate your ability to write clear issues and PRs, and show that you can navigate between tasks effectively.

#### Q9: How long do I have to complete these steps?

- There is no official deadline, so you can work on your own time. However, please note that most people who continued into the internship program completed the steps within 1-2 weeks.

#### Q10: How can I keep track of 10 steps vetting progress?

- You can keep track of your progress using the [Tracking Progress Tool here](trackprogress.md).

#### Q11: When does the internship start?

- When we have an active job posting and invite you to the First Steps, we primarily seek interns who can start immediately after completing the steps and having a meeting with us.
- If you're interested in an internship for a future semester or summer, please let us know in the Discord channel so we can stay in touch. We recommend checking back in the channel about a month before your intended start date to confirm if the internship program is active. If it is, you can then begin the First Steps process. This ensures you are following the most up-to-date version of the First Steps.
- If we have more qualified virtual interns completing the first steps than we can accommodate at one time, we may request during the initial meeting that you start the internship in 1-3 months, if that works for you.

### Technical Questions

#### Q1: What do I do if I already have a github.io with my username?

You have a few options:

  1. **Rename the Repository:**
     If you are still using the forked repository and don’t want to overwrite it, go to the repository settings and rename it to `<YourUsername-ole>.github.io`.
     Then deploy it to GitHub Pages by selecting **"master branch"** under the GitHub Pages section in the repository settings.
     You can access the forked OLE repository at: `<YourUsername>.github.io/<YourUsername-ole>.github.io/`
  2. **Delete the Repository:**
     If you are no longer using the repository, rename or delete it and follow the First Steps guide to set up a fresh fork.
  3. **Use an Organization:**
     If you are still using the repository but want to fork a new one, [create a free organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/) that belongs to your personal account, then fork our `treehouses.github.io` repository with your new organization as the owner. Afterwards, the repository will be accessible at: `<orgname>.github.io`

#### Q2: What should I do if I encounter Host key verification failed?

- If you encounter the error "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED" or "Host key verification failed" when trying to SSH into your Raspberry Pi, it means the host key has changed. This typically happens after re-installing the Raspberry Pi image or modifying its configuration.
- To resolve this issue, remove the old host key by running: `ssh-keygen -R <hostname>`, where `<hostname>` is whatever you just attempted to SSH into, typically the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.
