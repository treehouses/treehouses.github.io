    * Just like a computer terminal, the Treehouses Remote app allows you to interact with your Raspberry Pi using CLI (command line interface)
1. In the Terminal window type `treehouses detectrpi` and "send" it 
    * You can also access this command without writing: tap the `Commands` button at the top right of your screen to display a set of pre-entered commands you can use.
  
1. Now type `treehouses default network`
    * Here we are preparing to get internet access
1. Reboot the system by entering the command `reboot` and go back to the home screen to re-connect to your Pi
1. Back in the terminal type `treehouses bridge "wifiname" treehouses "wifipassword"`, and replace `wifiname` with the name of your wifi network, and `wifipassword` with the password.
1. Reboot once again
