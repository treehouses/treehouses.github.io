Welcome to treehouses
=====================

What is treehouses?
-------------------

treehouses is the name of our system allowing us to share our different learning platforms via the Rasperry Pi series of single-board computer devices.

Currently the Raspberry Pi models supported are: the zero W, the Pi 3, the Pi 3B+ and the Pi 4


Main system branches
--------------------

treehouses is constructed of several parts:

### cli

cli is a platform by which we are scripting the different commands to be entered in the Raspberry Pi terminal

### builder

This is where our different images intended for the Raspberry Pi are being built.

### remote

Currently in remote, we are developing an app for Android devices which interact with the terminal of the Raspberry Pi.
