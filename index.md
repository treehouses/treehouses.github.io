## Welcome to the treehouses project!

The [Open Learning Exchange](http://www.ole.org/) is a social benefit and for-purpose organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our mission is to provide universal quality education using open source materials and technology to overcome educational barriers.

This [MDwiki](https://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md) serves as an information repository for [treehouses](https://github.com/treehouses), a project of the Open Learning Exchange.


The  project is divided into several parts to meet the needs of different users, including those participating in our Virtual Intern program. Open Learning Exchange believes that **everyone** has the right to a quality basic education and works to provide this through the Raspberry Pi single board computers.
