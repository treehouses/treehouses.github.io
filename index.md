# Welcome!

This MDwiki serves as an information repository for treehouses, a project of the Open Learning Exchange.  Please feel free to join us on our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/treehouses/Lobby).

The treehouses project is divided into several parts to meet the needs of different users, including those participating in our Virtual Intern program.

If you are a new Virtual Intern, please go to the "Virtual Interns" tab and go to "Introduction / First Steps", or [click here](pages/vi/firststeps.md) to get started!  Please remember that many team members are available to help you on Gitter chat.

The [Open Learning Exchange](http://www.ole.org/) is a social benefit and for-purpose organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our mission is to provide universal quality education using open source materials and technology to overcome educational barriers.
